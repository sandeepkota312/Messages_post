# Messages_post_api
This is a social media application that allows users to post messages and "like" other users' messages. I have developed a backend API for the application using Django and PostgreSQL. 

This API should allow users to: 
1. Post a new message 
2. View a list of all messages, with the most recent messages first 
3. Like a message by clicking a button 
4. View the total number of likes for each message
